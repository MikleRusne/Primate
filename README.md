# Primate (10 Feb-24 Feb 2021)
## Formerly Sapient
DSA project using Unreal Engine</br>
Uses Blueprints to create a basic climbing system.</br>
Uses C++ to create a mapper for the climbable ledges for pre-optimization of procedurally generated levels.

# Update
The site where I uploaded this project to be graded, wipes submissions after three months of grading.</br>
Basically, this project has been sent to the shadow realm, and only an early increment, where I made a climbing system and basic discovery, remains.</br>
This project should no longer be used as a reference.
